# JNovelAIAPI

This is a decently-functional Java library that facilitates usage of the NovelAI official API. It handles _most_ things for you automatically, such as rate-limiting (one request per second), parsing responses, tokenizing, etc.

This was originally created for my own use, but then I realized that other people might also find it useful. Feel free to make an Issue if you run into a bug or functionality limitation.
